        <h2> Denim</h2>
        <p>
            Cold hand wash separately, wash inside out. Colour may transfer. 
            We recommend hanging or folding the piece when storing and either ironing or steaming post wash.
             Use a soft detergent, avoid over-washing to extend the lifespan of your denim piece.

        <h2>Knit</h2>
        <p>
            Hand wash cold and dry flat. Avoid hanging.
            The natural fibres of the wool will change the garment over time resulting in a brushed, texture finish.
            To restore the garment to its original state, use a pilling comb or fabric shaver
